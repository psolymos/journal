## TOC

1. Introduction
  * Why this book? (I have been using it since 2007?, share some tips)
  * Why make a poster in the 1st place? (Pros and cons, and sometimes an oral is downgraded)
  * Why Scribus? (Software and why it matters, full control, professional look, cool open source tools and skillset)
2. Getting started
  * Your research that you are presenting
  * Conference poster guidelines (important dates, format, orientation, dimensions)
  * Software we need (must, and optional, e.g. LaTeX and others)
  * Create a folder and start collecting necessary files there (files like logos of institutions or sponsors etc.)
3. Storyboard
4. Layout and dimensions
5. Fonts (font types, typefaces, font size, legibility, readibility, eye tracking)
6. Colors (contrasts, color blinds, color palettes: [here](https://wiki.scribus.net/canvas/How_to_create_your_own_colours), [here](http://www.pictaculous.com/), [here](https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-concepts-palettes.html), [here](https://docs.gimp.org/en/gimp-palette-dialog.html) for creating/editing palettes with webapp and GIMP, and how to add them to Scribus)
7. Illustrations:
  * photos/images (GIMP)
  * line drawings (Inkscape: [here](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/index.html), [here](http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/images/Introduction_to_Inkscape_by_Gavin_Corley.pdf)),
  * comics?
  * figures/plots (reproducible research using R, python, etc.)
  * flowcharts (hand drawn in Scribus, specialized software: DiagrammeR, Graphviz, diagram packages; Dia, Scribus, Google Drive, [https://www.draw.io/](https://www.draw.io/), [TikZ in LaTeX](http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/simple-flow-chart/))
  * maps ([QGIS](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/))
8. Tables (native Scribus tables, LaTeX tables, markdown/pandoc)
9. Math notation (simple ones natively, complex ones with LaTeX: [math notation links](http://cazencott.info/index.php/post/2014/08/15/Making-posters-with-Scribus))
10. Printing the poster (paper types, storage, travel, print at destination, foldable, multi-piece, price vs. color density)
11. Presenting your poster: shameless self promotion (engagement, social media in action, QR code in jpg/eps, handouts, links, cards)
12. Follow-up after congress (conversion, sharing the poster at Slideshare or similar outlet, social media)

## Goals

1. Write book and develop the poster template.
2. Reproduce the template from scratch and make a tutorial video.
3. Make mini videos (each chapter, really):
  * GIMP for photo/image manipulation
  * Inkscape for line drawings
  * Find something for flowcharts
  * QGIS for maps
  * LaTeX for math and tables
  * R for reproducible/modifiable stats plots

### Scientific literature about eye tracking etc.

### Readibility and legibility

Serif vs. sans-serif fonts: [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif#Readability_and_legibility), [blog](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/03/serif-vs-sans-the-final-battle/), [literature](http://alexpoole.info/academic/literaturereview.html).

> Finally, we should accept that most reasonably designed typefaces in mainstream use will be equally legible, and that it makes much more sense to argue in favour of serif or sans serif typefaces on aesthetic grounds than on the question of legibility.

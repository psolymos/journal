* Why poster? Pros and cons, and sometimes an oral is downgraded
* Organization (storyboard, file formats and put them in a directory, reproducible code)
* Software and why it matters
* Layout
* Sizes
* Fonts
* Colors
* Line drawings/sketches, figures/plots, flowcharts, maps, photos/images
* Tables
* Math notation
* Printing
* Presenting
* Engagement, conversion (pre and post congress follow up), QR code (jpg, eps, svg)


1. Write book and develop the poster template.
2. Reproduce the template from scratch and make a tutorial video.

Make mini videos:

* GIMP for photo/image manipulation
* Inkscape for line drawings ([here](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/index.html), [here](http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/images/Introduction_to_Inkscape_by_Gavin_Corley.pdf))
* Find something for flowcharts (DiagrammeR, Graphviz, diagram packages; Dia, Scribus, Google Drive, [https://www.draw.io/](https://www.draw.io/); [TikZ in LaTeX](http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/simple-flow-chart/))
* QGIS for maps ([here](http://www.qgistutorials.com/en/))
* LaTeX for math and tables?
* R for reproducible/modifiable stats plots


### Scientific literature about eye tracking etc.

From [this](http://betterposters.blogspot.ca/2010/10/eye-tracking.html) blogpost, here are 2 refs:

1. Chu S, Paul N, Ruel L. 2009. Using eye tracking technology to examine the effectiveness of design elements on news websites. Information Design Journal 17(1): 31-43. http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/idj.17.1.04chu
2. Holmqvist K, Wartenberg C. 2005. The role of local design factors for newspaper reading behaviour â€“ an eye-tracking perspective. Lund University Cognitive Studies 127: 1-21. http://www.lucs.lu.se/LUCS/127/LUCS.127.pdf

### Readibility and legibility

Serif vs. sans-serif fonts: [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif#Readability_and_legibility), [blog](http://www.webdesignerdepot.com/2013/03/serif-vs-sans-the-final-battle/), [literature](http://alexpoole.info/academic/literaturereview.html)

> Finally, we should accept that most reasonably designed typefaces in mainstream use will be equally legible, and that it makes much more sense to argue in favour of serif or sans serif typefaces on aesthetic grounds than on the question of legibility.

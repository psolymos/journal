An update (v 0.1-1) of the [**intrval**](https://github.com/psolymos/intrval) package was recently published on CRAN. The package simplifies interval related logical operations (read more about the motivation in [this](http://peter.solymos.org/code/2016/12/02/relational-operators-for-intervals-with-the-intrval-r-package.html) post).
So what is new in this version? Some of the inconsistencies in the 1st CRAN release have been cleaned up, and I have been pushed hard (see GitHub [issue](https://github.com/psolymos/intrval/issues/6) to implement all the 16 
interval-to-interval operators.
These operators define the open/closed nature of the lower/upper
limits of the intervals on the left and right hand side of the `o`
in the middle as in `%[]o[]%`.

Interval 1:  | Interval 2: `[]` |  `[)` |  `(]` |  `()`
-----------------|--------------|--------------|--------------|--------------
`[]` | `%[]o[]%`    | `%[]o[)%`    | `%[]o(]%`    | `%[]o()%`
`[)` | `%[)o[]%`    | `%[)o[)%`    | `%[)o(]%`    | `%[)o()%`
`(]` | `%(]o[]%`    | `%(]o[)%`    | `%(]o(]%`    | `%(]o()%`
`()` | `%()o[]%`    | `%()o[)%`    | `%()o(]%`    | `%()o()%`

The overlap of two closed intervals, [a1, b1] and [a2, b2],
is evaluated by the `%[o]%` (alias for `%[]o[]%`)
operator (`a1 <= b1`, `a2 <= b2`).
Endpoints can be defined as a vector with two values
(`c(a1, b1)`)or can be stored in matrix-like objects or a lists
in which case comparisons are made element-wise.

If lengths do not match, shorter objects are recycled.
These value-to-interval operators work for numeric (integer, real)
and ordered vectors, and object types which are measured at
least on ordinal scale (e.g. dates), see Examples.
Note: interval endpoints
are sorted internally thus ensuring the conditions
`a1 <= b1` and `a2 <= b2` is not necessary.

```R
c(2, 3) %[]o[]% c(0, 1)
list(0:4, 1:5) %[]o[]% c(2, 3)
cbind(0:4, 1:5) %[]o[]% c(2, 3)
data.frame(a=0:4, b=1:5) %[]o[]% c(2, 3)
```

If lengths do not match, shorter objects are recycled.
These value-to-interval operators work for numeric (integer, real)
and ordered vectors, and object types which are measured at
least on ordinal scale (e.g. dates).

`%)o(%` is used for the negation of two closed interval overlap,
directional evaluation is done via the operators
`%[<o]%` and `%[o>]%`.
The overlap of two open intervals
is evaluated by the `%(o)%` (alias for `%()o()%`).
`%]o[%` is used for the negation of two open interval overlap,
directional evaluation is done via the operators
`%(<o)%` and `%(o>)%`.
Overlap operators with mixed endpoint do not have
negation and directional counterparts.

Equal     | Not equal  | Less than  | Greater than
----------|------------|------------|----------------
 `%[o]%`  | `%)o(%`    | `%[<o]%`   | `%[o>]%`
 `%(o)%`  | `%]o[%`    | `%(<o)%`   | `%(o>)%`

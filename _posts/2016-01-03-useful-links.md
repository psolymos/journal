Reading all about stuff that can or needs to be done when someone
wants to start an online business is mind-boggling.
To sort things out, here are few links to start with, annotated
so that I know what is what.

## Organizing tasks and ideas

There are many tasks that need not to be forgotten. As my father
used to say: `ha nincs eszed, legyen noteszed' (if you have
no brain, use a notebook --- translated from Hungarian).

I just started [Trello](http://trello.com) which seems good enough for the job,
and the feature diff between the free and gold version is not huge.

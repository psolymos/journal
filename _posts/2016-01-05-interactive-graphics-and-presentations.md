## Interactive graphics

* [d3js](http://d3js.org/), see example about [causes of death](http://flowingdata.com/2016/01/05/causes-of-death/), and [books](http://flowingdata.com/books/).

## html and js based presentation tools

* [jmpress](http://jmpressjs.github.io/docs/index.html), [example](http://jmpressjs.github.com/jmpress.js/examples/impress/)
* [reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/) running on [slides.com](http://slides.com)
* [deck.js](http://imakewebthings.com/deck.js/)
* [slidesjs](http://www.slidesjs.com/) is a responsive plugin for jQuery
* [flowtime.js](http://flowtime-js.marcolago.com/) seems to best suited for lattice type material (like comics) without easy animations (that can be added on top I guess).
* [remark.js](http://remarkjs.com/) is good for general purpose stuff (e.g. es in [datacloning.org](http://datacloning.org)).

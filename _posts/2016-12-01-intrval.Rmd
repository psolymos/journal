I recently posted a piece about [how to write and document special functions in R](http://peter.solymos.org/code/2016/11/26/how-to-write-and-document-special-functions-in-r.html). I meant that as a prelude for the topic I am writing about in this post. Let me start at the beginning. The other day Dirk Eddelbuettel tweeted about the new release of the [**data.table**](https://cran.r-project.org/package=data.table) package (v1.9.8). 
There were [new features announced](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/news.html) for joins based on `%inrange%` and `%between%`. That got me thinking: it would be really cool to generalize this idea for different intervals, for example as `x %[]% c(a, b)`.

## Motivation

We want to evaluate if values of `x` satisfy the condition `x >= a & x <= b` given that `a <= b`. Typing `x %[]% c(a, b)` instead of the previous expression is not much shorter (14 vs. 15 characters with counting spaces). But considering the `a <= b` condition as well, it becomes a saving (`x >= min(a, b) & x <= mmax(a, b)` is 31 characters long). And sorting is really important, because by flipping `a` and `b`, we get quite different answers: 

```R
x <- 5
x >= 1 & x <= 10
# [1] TRUE
x >= 10 & x <= 1
# [1] FALSE
```

Also, `min` and `max` will not be very useful when we want to vectorize the expression. We need to use `pmin` and `pmax` for obvious reasons:

```R
x >= min(1:10, 10:1) & x <= max(10:1, 1:10)
# [1] TRUE
x >= pmin(1:10, 10:1) & x <= pmax(10:1, 1:10)
# [1] TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE
```

If interval endpoints can also be open or closed, and allowing them to flip around makes the semantics of left/right closed/open interval definitions hard. We can thus all agree that there is a need for an expression, like `x %[]% c(a, b)`, that is _compact_, _flexible_, and _invariant_ to endpoint sorting. This is exactly what the [**intrval**](https://github.com/psolymos/intrval) package is for!

## What's in the package

Functions for evaluating if values of vectors are within 
different open/closed intervals
(`x %[]% c(a, b)`), or if two closed
intervals overlap (`c(a1, b1) %[o]% c(a2, b2)`).
Operators for negation and directional relations also implemented.

### Value-to-interval relations

Values of `x` are compared to interval endpoints `a` and `b` (`a <= b`).
Endpoints can be defined as a vector with two values (`c(a, b)`): these values will be compared as a single interval with each value in `x`.
If endpoints are stored in a matrix-like object or a list,
comparisons are made element-wise. 

```R
x <- rep(4, 5)
a <- 1:5
b <- 3:7
cbind(x=x, a=a, b=b)
x %[]% cbind(a, b) # matrix
x %[]% data.frame(a=a, b=b) # data.frame
x %[]% list(a, b) # list
```

If lengths do not match, shorter objects are recycled. Return values are logicals.
Note: interval endpoints are sorted internally thus ensuring the condition
`a <= b` is not necessary.

These value-to-interval operators work for numeric (integer, real) and ordered vectors, and object types which are measured at least on ordinal scale (e.g. dates).

#### Closed and open intervals

The following special operators are used to indicate closed (`[`, `]`) or open (`(`, `)`) interval endpoints:

Operator | Expression       | Condition
---------|------------------|-------------------
 `%[]%`  | `x %[]% c(a, b)` | `x >= a & x <= b`
 `%[)%`  | `x %[)% c(a, b)` | `x >= a & x < b`
 `%(]%`  | `x %(]% c(a, b)` | `x > a & x <= b`
 `%()%`  | `x %()% c(a, b)` | `x > a & x < b`

#### Negation and directional relations

Eqal     | Not equal | Less than | Greater than
---------|-----------|-----------|----------------
 `%[]%`  | `%)(%`    | `%[<]%`   | `%[>]%`
 `%[)%`  | `%)[%`    | `%[<)%`   | `%[>)%`
 `%(]%`  | `%](%`    | `%(<]%`   | `%(>]%`
 `%()%`  | `%][%`    | `%(<)%`   | `%(>)%`

### Interval-to-interval relations

The overlap of two closed intervals, [`a1`, `b1`] and [`a2`, `b2`],
is evaluated by the `%[o]%` operator (`a1 <= b1`, `a2 <= b2`). 
Endpoints can be defined as a vector with two values
(`c(a1, b1)`)or can be stored in matrix-like objects or a lists
in which case comparisons are made element-wise.
Note: interval endpoints
are sorted internally thus ensuring the conditions
`a1 <= b1` and `a2 <= b2` is not necessary.

```R
c(2:3) %[o]% c(0:1)
list(0:4, 1:5) %[o]% c(2:3)
cbind(0:4, 1:5) %[o]% c(2:3)
data.frame(a=0:4, b=1:5) %[o]% c(2:3)
```

If lengths do not match, shorter objects are recycled.
These value-to-interval operators work for numeric (integer, real)
and ordered vectors, and object types which are measured at
least on ordinal scale (e.g. dates).

`%)o(%` is used for the negation,
directional evaluation is done via the operators `%[<o]%` and `%[o>]%`.

Eqal      | Not equal  | Less than  | Greater than
----------|------------|------------|----------------
 `%[0]%`  | `%)0(%`    | `%[<0]%`   | `%[0>]%`

### Operators for discrete variables

The previous operators will return `NA` for unordered factors.
Set overlap can be evaluated by the base `%in%` operator and its negation
`%nin%`. (This feature is really [redundant](http://peter.solymos.org/code/2016/11/26/how-to-write-and-document-special-functions-in-r.html), I know, but decided to include regardless...)
